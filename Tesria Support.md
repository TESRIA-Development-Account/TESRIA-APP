TESRIA is an app for iPads that enables a sleek infotainment experience for your rear passangers.

Features of TESRIA include:

•	⁠Rear heated seats control

•	⁠Pause/Play music from the car

•	⁠Skip/Go back to previous song

•	⁠Control car volume

•	⁠A built in theater that includes Youtube, Disney+ and Netflix, so you dont have to leave the app if you want to watch a movie or a video, enabling a much more immersive experience

•	⁠An entire board of controls for the Trunk, Frunk, Charge Port, and Car Lock, as well as vehicle name, motion status and battery percentage and charge status.

•	⁠A kids mode that hides the board of controls to minimize the risk of accidental command from younger ones
